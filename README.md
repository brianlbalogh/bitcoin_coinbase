Usage
-----
When a user chooses the "Bitcoin via Coinbase" payment method, they will be presented with an order summary as the next step (prices are shown in whatever currency they've selected for shopping).  Upon confirming their order, a payment window is displayed by coinbase.com.  Once payment is received, the order is submitted as normal.

In your Admin control panel, you can see the orders made via Bitcoins just as you could see for any other payment mode.  The status you selected in the configuration steps above will indicate whether the order has been paid for or an error has occurred.

Note: This extension does not provide a means of automatically pulling a current BTC exchange rate for presenting BTC prices to shoppers.
